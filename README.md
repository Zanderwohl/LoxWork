# Crafting Interpreters Work

This is my code from following Bob Nystrom's book *Crafting Interpreters* which can be found at [craftinginterpreters.com](https://craftinginterpreters.com/).

This is not identical to his reference implementation of the Lox language. I have added my own pieces for practice or fun. This repository is mostly for my personal use, and for anyone else who may want to look at how someone else has coded parts of the textbook.

## Licensing

Much of the code here is Nystrom's, whose licensing info for his book and code can be found [here](https://github.com/munificent/craftinginterpreters/blob/master/LICENSE).
